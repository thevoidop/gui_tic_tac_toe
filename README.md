# Tic-Tac-Toe (GUI)

Welcome to the "gui_tic_tac_toe" repository! This repository contains a Python implementation of Tic-Tac-Toe with a graphical user interface (GUI). The game supports both single-player and multi-player modes, with a user-friendly interface built using the `customtkinter` library.

## Getting Started

  ### Prerequisites
  
  Before running the game, ensure you have the following prerequisites installed:
  
  - Python 3.x
  - `customtkinter` library

  ### Installation
  
  1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/thevoidop/gui_tic_tac_toe.git
     ```
  2. Navigate to the project directory:
  
     ```bash
     cd gui_tic_tac_toe
     ```
  3. Install the required dependencies:
  
     ```bash
     pip install customtkinter
     ```
## Usage
  ### Running the Game
  - To start the Tic-Tac-Toe game, run the following command:
    
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
  
  ### Game Modes
  
  The game supports two modes:
  
   1. Single-Player Mode: Play against the computer AI.
     
   2. Multi-Player Mode: Play against another person.

### Features

  - #### Single-Player Mode
    In single-player mode, the computer AI (represented by "O") makes automatic moves after the player's move. The player (represented by "X") can enjoy a challenging game against the AI.

  - #### Multi-Player Mode
    In multi-player mode, two players take turns making moves. The current player is indicated on the GUI, making it easy for players to track the game progress.

  - #### GUI Design
    The graphical user interface is designed using the customtkinter library, providing an aesthetically pleasing and intuitive experience for players. The GUI includes features such as customizable colors and a responsive layout.
